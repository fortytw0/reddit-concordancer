      "\n",
      "The problem when you have been wedded to something flawed is that, when realisation does eventually begin to dawn, the unravelling has already gathered such pace that much of the good work has been undermined and you are at risk of going back to square one. \n",
      "\n",
      "And this is where Manchester United now find themselves with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer: players going backwards, confidence shattered, fault lines widening, a strategic black hole and a team spiralling under a manager who no longer inspires trust. There is none of the toxicity that marked that end of Jose Mourinho’s bloody regime but the ship is still going down and it’s a pitiful sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the moment, Solskjaer continues to cling on to his job but four points from 18 is relegation form and even United’s great survivor is running out of lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "United’s bench against Manchester City at Old Trafford was a monument to how badly the whole thing has sailed off course: Jadon Sancho, the £73 million summer recruit who was supposed to light up the right wing, wondering where he figures in the sudden lurch to a back five, Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial, Jesse Lingard and, of course, Donny van de Beek, who looks like more of a mascot these days than Fred the Red. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was the 35th anniversary on Saturday of Sir Alex Ferguson’s appointment as United manager but that fabled “DNA” Solskjaer bangs on about could have stood for “Do Not Attack” against City as a team stripped of self-belief and hamstrung by the system, selection and a whole lot in between surrendered to a vastly superior enterprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "United had four touches in City’s box, their fewest in a Premier League game since Opta began compiling such information. City completed 753 passes, a record in the league’s data driven era. David De Gea, astonishingly, faced more shots on target from his own players than United managed at Ederson, the City goalkeeper.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than a fifth - 21 per cent - of United’s 63 Premier League defeats at Old Trafford have come under Solskjaer, who has won just 11 of his 27 home league fixtures dating back to the end of the 2019/20 campaign. \n",
      "\n",
      "Players are crumbling. Luke Shaw is resembling the left back broken by Mourinho. Harry Maguire would not get in the Leicester team he left for £85m at the moment. Aaron Wan-Bissaka is sinking by the week. Mistakes are creeping back into De Gea’s game, even if he has been by far his team's best performer. The Fred and Scott McTominay pile on feels unsustainable. Bruno Fernandes, for so long United’s talisman, is finding himself being dragged down with the rest of them. Edinson Cavani is injured, again. Paul Pogba is suspended, his indiscipline having caught up with him. We know how Sancho and Lingard have looked in different hands at different clubs but what about Rashford and Martial? And is Cristiano Ronaldo now regretting his return?\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever the rights and wrongs of United’s decision to appoint Solskjaer permanently after a happy honeymoon period, the warning signs that change was necessary to make the jump from established top four side to serious title challengers were evident long before they limped to a penalty shoot-out defeat to Villarreal in the Europa League final in May.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet United, “more convinced than ever” they were “on the right track” to quote executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, responded by handing Solskjaer a new three-year contract and, having hurtled almost blindly into this brick wall, seem unsure where to go next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Antonio Conte was available in the wake of the 5-0 capitulation at home to Liverpool but United were not interested, the former Chelsea manager has since been snapped up by Spurs and a shortage of attainable alternatives is a problem but then when does the timing ever seem right for United? They have either not moved swiftly or decisively when desirable candidates have been available (they could have had Mauricio Pochettino or Thomas Tuchel if they had not been fixated on the Solskjaer experiment), they have botched the pitch (think Jurgen Klopp and all that “Disneyland” guff) or they find themselves down a cul-de-sac, like now. \n",
      "\n",
      "But it is also worth asking why United now seem so fearful of appointing a demanding manager? Was Ferguson not stubborn and bloody-minded? Do United seriously think Pep Guardiola, Klopp and Tuchel are not challenging to work with? During an informal round-table discussion with Khaldoon al-Mubarak, the City chairman, and his chief executive, Ferran Soriano, a few years ago, it was made abundantly clear just how relentlessly demanding Guardiola is to work with. Pochettino? Was the Argentine not challenging the Tottenham board over transfers in the year before his eventual sacking?\n",
      "\n",
      "But that is what the “best-in-class” in any walk of life do: they drive higher standards and are unafraid to put noses out of joint when needed for the greater good but being difficult, at times, does not mean they cannot manage up and down, that they scorch anything and everything in their path.\n",

      "United seem irrationally scarred by the Mourinho years when it took Kelly Cates, the Sky Sports anchor, to point out on Saturday that the Portuguese, and his predecessor Louis van Gaal, had long past their best by the time they rocked up at Old Trafford. The reality is United have not appointed a manager-coach who was at the top of his game since Ferguson retired.\n",
      "\n",
      "We decry the absence of loyalty in football but blind faith can, in its own way, be as corrosive as a hire and fire mentality and Old Trafford has become a cosy club, where there is plenty of backslapping but few who can see the wood for the trees. This is the Glazer legacy: dismal appointments and the death of ambition, where fourth is the new first and the promise of a brave new world never materialises.\n",

A friend and I were talking about getting tickets to see a game at OT, because it's been a while since we've been, we were even willing to shell out for a more expensive ticket package if that was the only way we could get them, but now neither of us can be bothered, such is the mediocrity of the club.\n",

I just can't accept the manner in which we're losing to teams either, to be so comprehensively outplayed by our rivals shows how far we've fallen as a club. The club is broken from top to bottom; the Glazers make decisions based primarily on money - hence the incompetent individuals at multiple levels of the club - and they've cynically tried to play on the fan's loyalty by appointing former players in the hopes that it will be less likely fans will turn on them. Also, Ole has done some good at the club, but he and his coaching staff simply lack the skill and experience to challenge the likes of Guardiola, Klopp and Tuchel, three legitimately elite managers.\n",

Football should be a nice escape for fans, not something that adds more misery and negativity.\n",

Perhaps the frustration stems from the club’s ability to bring in a coach that is truly gifted in the mould of your Pep and Klopp. I think Pep and Klopp both show a desire to perfect the projects given to them, and not leave when times are tough. \n",

We’ve been terrible for the past decade, I don’t mind being terrible for another half of the season or even another if Ole is the right man for the job in the long run. So unless we’ve got a young coach who has the potential to build something huge in the long run (think Ten Haag/Nagelsmann), we’re just going to be running in circles if we keep hiring “mercenaries” like what we’ve been doing before Ole. Conte probably falls in this category as well.\n",

      "Again, this is a hugely unpopular opinion so feel free to downvote all you want. I am equally frustrated and the Derby was the first game I abandoned in awhile. I just want what’s best for my club in the long run. If Ole under delivers and a new coach with potential becomes available to build another new project, that’s when we should probably consider. Hence, to me, who is available at this point in time that can do this for us?\n",
