There is none of the toxicity that marked that end of Jose Mourinho\u2019s bloody regime but the ship is still going down and it\u2019s a pitiful sight.\n\nFor the moment, Solskjaer continues to cling on to his job but four points from 18 is relegation form and even United\u2019s great survivor is running out of lives.\n\nUnited\u2019s bench against Manchester City at Old Trafford was a monument to how badly the whole thing has sailed off course: Jadon Sancho, the \u00a373 million summer recruit who was supposed to light up the right wing, wondering where he figures in the sudden lurch to a back five, Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial, Jesse Lingard and, of course, Donny van de Beek, who looks like more of a mascot these days than Fred the Red.\u00a0\n\nIt was the 35th anniversary on Saturday of Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s appointment as United manager but that fabled \u201cDNA\u201d Solskjaer bangs on about could have stood for \u201cDo Not Attack\u201d against City as a team stripped of self-belief and hamstrung by the system, selection and a whole lot in between surrendered to a vastly superior enterprise.\n\nUnited had four touches in City\u2019s box, their fewest in a Premier League game since Opta began compiling such information. City completed 753 passes, a record in the league\u2019s data driven era. David De Gea, astonishingly, faced more shots on target from his own players than United managed at Ederson, the City goalkeeper.\n\nMore than a fifth - 21 per cent - of United\u2019s 63 Premier League defeats at Old Trafford have come under Solskjaer, who has won just 11 of his 27 home league fixtures dating back to the end of the 2019/20 campaign. \n\nPlayers are crumbling. Luke Shaw is resembling the left back broken by Mourinho. Harry Maguire would not get in the Leicester team he left for \u00a385m at the moment. Aaron Wan-Bissaka is sinking by the week. Mistakes are creeping back into De Gea\u2019s game, even if he has been by far his team's best performer. The Fred and Scott McTominay pile on feels unsustainable. Bruno Fernandes, for so long United\u2019s talisman, is finding himself being dragged down with the rest of them. Edinson Cavani is injured, again. Paul Pogba is suspended, his indiscipline having caught up with him. We know how Sancho and Lingard have looked in different hands at different clubs but what about Rashford and Martial? And is Cristiano Ronaldo now regretting his return?\n\nWhatever the rights and wrongs of United\u2019s decision to appoint Solskjaer permanently after a happy honeymoon period, the warning signs that change was necessary to make the jump from established top four side to serious title challengers were evident long before they limped to a penalty shoot-out defeat to Villarreal in the Europa League final in May.\n\nYet United, \u201cmore convinced than ever\u201d they were \u201con the right track\u201d to quote executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, responded by handing Solskjaer a new three-year contract and, having hurtled almost blindly into this brick wall, seem unsure where to go next.\n\nAntonio Conte was available in the wake of the 5-0 capitulation at home to Liverpool but United were not interested, the former Chelsea manager has since been snapped up by Spurs and a shortage of attainable alternatives is a problem but then when does the timing ever seem right for United? They have either not moved swiftly or decisively when desirable candidates have been available (they could have had Mauricio Pochettino or Thomas Tuchel if they had not been fixated on the Solskjaer experiment), they have botched the pitch (think Jurgen Klopp and all that \u201cDisneyland\u201d guff) or they find themselves down a cul-de-sac, like now. \n\nBut it is also worth asking why United now seem so fearful of appointing a demanding manager? Was Ferguson not stubborn and bloody-minded? Do United seriously think Pep Guardiola, Klopp and Tuchel are not challenging to work with? During an informal round-table discussion with Khaldoon al-Mubarak, the City chairman, and his chief executive, Ferran Soriano, a few years ago, it was made abundantly clear just how relentlessly demanding Guardiola is to work with. Pochettino? Was the Argentine not challenging the Tottenham board over transfers in the year before his eventual sacking?\n\nBut that is what the \u201cbest-in-class\u201d in any walk of life do: they drive higher standards and are unafraid to put noses out of joint when needed for the greater good but being difficult, at times, does not mean they cannot manage up and down, that they scorch anything and everything in their path.\n\nUnited seem irrationally scarred by the Mourinho years when it took Kelly Cates, the Sky Sports anchor, to point out on Saturday that the Portuguese, and his predecessor Louis van Gaal, had long past their best by the time they rocked up at Old Trafford. The reality is United have not appointed a manager-coach who was at the top of his game since Ferguson retired.\n\nWe decry the absence of loyalty in football but blind faith can, in its own way, be as corrosive as a hire and fire mentality and Old Trafford has become a cosy club, where there is plenty of backslapping but few who can see the wood for the trees. This is the Glazer legacy: dismal appointments and the death of ambition, where fourth is the new first and the promise of a brave new world never materialises.\n\nI have often likened covering the post-Ferguson United to pushing food around a plate and the analogy is still holding firm.", "comment_author": "s610", "comment_created_utc": 1636356423.0, "comment_id": "hjs2e6q", "comment_score": 161, "comment_submission_id": "qp8aem", "comment_submission_title": "[James Ducker] No belief, no ambition, no plan - this is Manchester United under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.", "comment_subreddit": "t5_2rxse"}, {"comment_type": "secondary", "comment_body": "Blimey that is one strongly worded article.

There's a stunning lack of astute, level-headed analysis on United. What's happened with the team is not that difficult to understand, they might not have belief, but belief is a ridiculous word, it means nothing and reflects nothing. The club has ambition, that's why they keep making signings, and made fantastic signings in the summer. They had a plan, but the last-minute and frankly panicked move for Ronaldo meant that had to change.\n\nThis last part is what's driving the huge downturn in the progress they had made, they're failing to adapt the system to Ronaldo's presence, it's opening up holes all over the pitch, making the team less compact and easier to play through.\n\nRonaldo's a fantastic player, but the team has to change to accomodate him. For the last four seasons they've been signing and building toward a forward press and quick break kind of football, now they can't really do that, and it's a massive u-turn to make.\n\nThe good news is, the squad is great now, it's capable of playing a different way, and a different manager and coaches will be able to get a lot more from these players. The players are there to play a patient, slower build up, which suits Ronaldo, they aren't obliged to do a high press, and if they lose the ball up the pitch, they can do a play-breaking counter press the way City do, if they find a coach capable of implementing that. They have good covering defenders now, in Wan Bissaka and Varane, they have a keeper who comes out, in Henderson. You just need the guy who will put all those things together. They don't even really need to change Solskjaer, they just need a top quality, experienced coach working under him to get this shit implemented, someone who pushes him a little further away from footballing and tactical decisions.\n\nThere's so much depression here at the moment, but our front three is capable of being the best in the league over the next six or seven years. We've got a top class centre back pairing for the next four or five years, with Maguire and Varane. Two quality left backs, a decent right back, a couple of good midfielders (which is where we need the most work), a fantastic playmaker (possibly two), high quality fringe players, and some excellent experienced players too. Two great keepers, one of which I do believe will improve the team as a whole going forward, once he's given the chance to play.\n\nTry not to get fucked up by the last few weeks of poor performances, the basic make up of this squad is amazing, by far the best we've had since Fergie left.

A friend and I were talking about getting tickets to see a game at OT, because it's been a while since we've been, we were even willing to shell out for a more expensive ticket package if that was the only way we could get them, but now neither of us can be bothered, such is the mediocrity of the club.\n\nWe're already out of the title race, a top four finish is the best we can hope for and if West Ham maintain this sort of form then even that is in doubt. I just can't accept the manner in which we're losing to teams either, to be so comprehensively outplayed by our rivals shows how far we've fallen as a club. The club is broken from top to bottom; the Glazers make decisions based primarily on money - hence the incompetent individuals at multiple levels of the club - and they've cynically tried to play on the fan's loyalty by appointing former players in the hopes that it will be less likely fans will turn on them. Also, Ole has done some good at the club, but he and his coaching staff simply lack the skill and experience to challenge the likes of Guardiola, Klopp and Tuchel, three legitimately elite managers.\n\nDuring the 25 years I've supported United I've rarely come close to questioning why I continue to support and follow them as a football club, but for the first time in a while I'm thinking along those lines.

Perhaps the frustration stems from the club\u2019s ability to bring in a coach that is truly gifted in the mould of your Pep and Klopp. I think Pep and Klopp both show a desire to perfect the projects given to them, and not leave when times are tough. \n\nHence, that being said, which manager at this point of time can demonstrate such a potential and passion to stick at it, at this point of time? \n\nOle is out of his depth for sure, but wasn\u2019t SAF the same at his initial first few years? Let\u2019s not discount the fact that Ole has at his disposal mentors that SAF probably did not. We\u2019ve been terrible for the past decade, I don\u2019t mind being terrible for another half of the season or even another if Ole is the right man for the job in the long run. So unless we\u2019ve got a young coach who has the potential to build something huge in the long run (think Ten Haag/Nagelsmann), we\u2019re just going to be running in circles if we keep hiring \u201cmercenaries\u201d like what we\u2019ve been doing before Ole. Conte probably falls in this category as well.\n\nAgain, this is a hugely unpopular opinion so feel free to downvote all you want. I am equally frustrated and the Derby was the first game I abandoned in awhile. I just want what\u2019s best for my club in the long run.
